* Scenario in details
	* 0: prepare NODE_ID=3000 as CENTRAL
		- 0: export NODE_ID=3000
		- 0: create a wallet and a new blockchain
			- export CENTRAL_ADDRESS=`./myBlock createwallet | cut -f2 -d':'`
			- ./myBlock createblockchain -address $CENTRAL_ADDRESS
		- 0: copy blockchain as genesis blockchain
			- cp blockchain_3000.db blockchain_genesis.db 
	* 1: prepare NODE_ID=3001 as WALLETS
		- 1: export NODE_ID=3001
		- 1: create three wallets
			- export WALLET1_ADDRESS=`./myBlock createwallet | cut -f2 -d':'`
			- export WALLET2_ADDRESS=`./myBlock createwallet | cut -f2 -d':'`
			- export WALLET3_ADDRESS=`./myBlock createwallet | cut -f2 -d':'`
	* 0: send some coins from CENTRAL to WALLETS with immediately mining
		- 0: ./myBlock send -from $CENTRAL_ADDRESS -to $WALLET1_ADDRESS -amount 10 -mine
		- 0: ./myBlock send -from $CENTRAL_ADDRESS -to $WALLET2_ADDRESS -amount 10 -mine
	* 0: start NODE_ID=3000 - THE NODE MUST BE RUNNING UNTIL THE END OF THE SCENARIO
		- 0: ./myBlock startnode
	----------
	* 1: copy genesis blockchain as blockchain for NODE_ID=3001
		- 1: cp blockchain_genesis.db blockchain_3001.db
	* 1: start NODE_ID=3001
		- 1: ./myBlock startnode
		- it will download all the blocks from CENTRAL
